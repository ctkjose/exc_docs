EXC uses messages to decouple the logic of an application. The execution of your application is in essence your code responding to messages.

A message is send to indicate an **event** or to require an **action**. Messages are broadcasted by **event emitters** like the [appController](./doc_server_controllers.md). The `appController` is the main controller responsible for the life-cycle of your application and in EXC most messages are generated by the `appController`.

Handling messages is done mainly by [controllers](./doc_server_controllers.md). The main job of a controller is to responde to **messages**. A message may be an **action** from your front-end or you may get an **event** from the framework itself. See "[Adding your own controllers](./doc_server_controllers.md)" to learn more about creating your own controllers.


When a message is broadcasted to all active controllers is called **publishing a message**. In addition a controller maybe directed to **perform a message**.

A controller my handle a message as the **first responder** or as a callback to an event message. 


# Registering a handler for an event or action #

In a controller a message handler is a function, who's name follows a simple naming convention that we call the "message handler signature".

A function name that starts with "on" , for example `onAppStart` is considered a handler for the message `"AppStart"`.

```php
<?php
class recordController extends \exc\controller\viewController {
	public function onAppStart(){
		//my code here...
	}
}
```

We use the prefix "on" to identify functions as message handlers that EXC will automatically register as a callback. These automatic message handlers in your controller class are used when your controller class is loaded on request or explicitly by the user when calling `\exc\app::registerController($className, $classInstance)`.

We can also implement message handlers by registering a callback manually.
```php
<?php
$app = \exc\controller\appController::instance(); //get an instance of the app controller

$app->on( 'appStart', $callback ); //register for the event appStart
```



# Backend Messages #

The following is a list of events broadcasted by the `appController`.

| Name | Type | Description |

| appEnd | event | The backend finished a request and the app instance will be terminated. Arguments: None. |
| appAbort | event | The backend is aborting a request and the app instance will be terminated. Arguments: None. |
| appClientReady | event | The `$client` was initialized and is ready for interactions. Arguments: `$client`. |
| appClientCommit | event | The backend is about to send any `$client` interactions and the app's state to the front-end. Arguments: None. |
| appSendHeaders | event | The backend is sending the HTTP headers. Arguments: None. |
| appSendOutput | event | The backend is about to send output to the front-end. Usually HTML. Arguments: None. |
