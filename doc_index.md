**EXC** | DEV | [Documentation](./doc_index.md) | Version 1.0<BR>

## ExpressCODE ##

**ExpressCODE** (EXC) is a no frills, no fad, lets just get some work done framework to build web apps in JavaScript and PHP.

Creating web apps with EXC is meant to be simple, something that you can pickup and learn quickly. We put a lot of effort into making a framework for modern web apps that is simple and lightweight.

EXC combines a client-side JavaScript framework with a backend framework in PHP, both loosely couple yet fully integrated.

## Our goals are: ##

To reduce and simplify the components that you have to code to make a web application.

To keep the learning curve low.

To reduce the security and operational complexity of deploying an application.

To leverage robust architectures and environments. To be able to deploy your app with common hosting companies (even vhosts), and use technologies like apache, and nginx, that are well documented, easy to scale and extremely cost-effective.    

> : This documentation is in its early stages. Things are thrown together in a haphazard way, Sorry!.
